Orchestrate_Example
===================

This example demonstrates how you can perform configuration against test
machines by ansible using teflo.

**ATTENTION**

This example below has teflo installed in a virtual environment named teflo.
Please replace this virtual environment with the virtual environment you
created for teflo if it differs.

Pre-Run
-------

First lets review the content of the `scenario descriptor file <scenario.yml>`_.
This file contains a provision section which contains one host resource
defined. For the case of keeping this example simple, the host resource is
the localhost where teflo will be run. This way we can avoid any provisioning
of machines. The orchestrate section contains two actions to be processed.
Each action is an ansible playbook to be run. Each action has a *hosts* key
which defines which host resource to be run against (defined in the provision
section).

Run
---

To configure the machines under test, just run the following teflo command.

.. code-block:: none

    (teflo) $ teflo run -t provision -t orchestrate -s scenario.yml

You will see teflo skip over provisioning the machine due to its a static
machine. Orchestrate task will start and execute both the actions defined
against the hosts it was declared against. This example will print out
the system information and perform a mock 'fake' kernel update to demonstrate
teflos orchestrate capabilities.

You may have noticed the first orchestrate action had a cleanup key defined.
This means when the teflo cleanup task is run, prior to deleting the machines,
it would perform the configuration against the machines. This is helpful in
times where you want to remove some settings or unsubcribe from something that
you previously did.

To cleanup the machine, just execute the following teflo command below.

.. code-block:: none

    (teflo) $ teflo run -t cleanup -s .teflo/.results/results.yml -w .

We pointed teflo to the updated descriptor file. This provides teflo with
the updated information from the provision/orchestrate task.
